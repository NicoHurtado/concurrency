# Concurrency Simulation

This Python project demonstrates **concurrency and data streaming techniques** using:

- `multiprocessing`: Parallel execution using multiple processes.
- `threading`: Lightweight concurrent execution using threads.
- `generators`: Lazy evaluation of data streams.
- `pipelines`: Composable data processing flows.

The simulation uses **random jiu-jitsu attack names** to illustrate real-time, concurrent data generation and processing.

| Processes       | `multiprocessing_demo.py` | Demonstrates parallel execution with lock sharing. |
| Threads         | `threading_demo.py`       | Runs multiple threads with synchronized access.     |
| Lazy Generators | `generator_stream.py`     | Simulates delayed streaming of attacks.             |
| Pipelines       | `generator_pipeline.py`   | Composes generators into a processing chain.        |
